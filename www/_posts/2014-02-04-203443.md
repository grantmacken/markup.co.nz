summary: Pygments xquery language lexer needs updating to handle xquery3 https://github.com/spig/pygments-xquery-lexer/issues/1
categories: xquery xquery3 pygments

The pygments xquery language lexer does not recognise xquery 3 tokens.As github also uses Python Pygments so it might be worthwhile forking the project and try to update the lexer. If I've got time I will take a look ref: git hub issue.
