The Home Page
-------------

The home page will be a  *posts feed* consisting of *'post listings'*.

At the moment

1. This *activity stream* of my latest Articles and Notes and other 'post items' are in reverse
chonological order
2. **post listings**:  these will not be seperated out by post-type i.e. articles vs
notes vs images but clumped together in one listing. ( TODO )
3. Article will be shortened to 5 block elements
4. Titles are stored as lowercase  but are transformed via css ```text-transform: capitalize``
