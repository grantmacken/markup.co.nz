The Home Page
-------------

The home page will be a  *posts feed* consisting of *'post listings'*.

At the moment

1. This *activity stream* of my latest Articles and Notes and other 'post items' are in reverse
chronological order
2. **post listings**:  these will not be separated out by post-type i.e. articles vs
notes vs images but clumped together in one listing. ( TODO )
3. Articles will be shortened to 5 block elements with a *call to action* ... continue reading

4. Titles are stored as lowercase  but are transformed via CSS ```text-transform: capitalize``
