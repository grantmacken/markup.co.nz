summary: Adding my  microfomated h-card to this site and including h-cards contacts
categories: indieweb microformats contacts
---

My URL therefore I am. If my indeweb home-page provides my identity, I need to
place my h-card right there on my homepage.

Under my templates folder I create a h-card include. The root element will
contains the microfomat classname h-card. Under the root element are flat marked
up data *properties* which provide profile and or contact info for the card.

These properties will be generated maybe from the build.properties file but at
the mo are hard coded in the template .
