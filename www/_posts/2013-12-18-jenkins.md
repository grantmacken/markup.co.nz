Installing and using Jenkins

With the mu generator we are aiming to quickly develop and deploy websites.
Our text editor (komodo) provides a rapid protyping workspace using a
localhost server for instant browser preview when we alter our content, styles or
scripts.

When we bring our project files under version source control(git) every time we
push our local commits to to remote githup repo we create versioned backup of
our project. This means we can backout of any changes made if required.

When deploy to our localhost server we want to deploy to our remote server at
the same time, but not always! To avoid a remote deployment we want to create a
branch off the master, work on that branch, then merge the branch back into the
master. When a change occurs on the remote master **only then** we want to trigger a
remote deployment of our project.



To make this work we will use [http://jenkins-ci.org/](jenkins) and the [github plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitHub+plugin)
for jenkins and use Githubs [Post-Receive Hooks](https://help.github.com/articles/post-receive-hooks)

ToDo: jenkins setup

Proccess
--------

If on git 'origin/master' ( not on a 'git branch' ), then Github
web hook posts build info to Jenkins which then replicates( builds )
'origin/master' build in Jenkins workspace.
