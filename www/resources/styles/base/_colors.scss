 *    $cs-primary — set the primary color in a color scheme.
    $cs-scheme — mono, complement, triad, tetrad, analogic, accented-analogic
    $cs-hue-offset — Amount of hue adjustment in schemes.
    $cs-brightness-offset — Amount of brightness adjustment in schemes.
    $cs-color-model — rgb, ryb


    functions

Drop these functions in wherever you want to use a color from the scheme.
You can manipulate them further to make them work with your design.
These should be considered a good starting point as you might want to tweak a little further.

    cs-primary() — primary color.
    cs-secondary() — secondary color.
    cs-tertiary() — tertiary color.
    cs-quadrary() — quadrary color.

/* Base Color
 *

We start with
defining our primary color

pick a scheme
mono | complement |triad | tetrad | analogic | accented-analogic

Analogous color schemes use adjacent colors from the color wheel.

The last one is Accented Analogic which is the same as analogic except it features
a fourth color which is the Complementary color to the original color

Analogic colors

This scheme is made by base color and its adjacent colors - two colors identically on both sides. It always looks very elegantly and clear, the result has less tension and it's uniformly warm, or cold. If a color on the warm-cold border is chosen, the color with opposite "temperature" may be used for accenting the other two colors.

Additional input field sets the distance of adjacent colors - values between 15-30° are optimal.
You can also add the contrast color, the scheme is then supplemented with the complement of the base color.
It must be treated only as a complement - it adds tension to the palette, and it's too aggressive when overused.
However, used in details and as accent of main colors, it can be very effective and elegan
