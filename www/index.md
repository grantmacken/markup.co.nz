Projects I am working on, available on [github](https://github.com/grantmacken)

1. [MU GENERATOR](https://github.com/grantmacken/mu-generator): What we are
aiming for is the mu-generator creating the scaffolding for projects that can be
opened in a modern 'text editor' ( komodo , sublime , etc ), and these project
work-spaces enabling a 'rapid prototyping' workflow for quickly building
websites that can be packaged and deployed as eXist-db apps. You can also
feedback the project to the generator as a reusable theme for generating other
projects.

2. [NGINX-EXIST-UBUNTU](https://github.com/grantmacken/nginx-eXist-ubuntu) The
projects purpose is to help users set up Nginx as as a reverse proxy for
eXist-db application server for both local development and remote production.
Included are the files and scripts I have used to set up such local development
and remote production server environments which are capable of serving multiple
web-site domains without altering the Nginx con every time you add a new site.
The production server makes use of Nginx proxy cache capabilities.

3. [XQUERY-UDL](xquery-udl) An attempt a building a Xquery 'User-Defined
Language' for Komodo for the Komodo IDE and Komodo Edit. xpi installation file
included.

Some mu generator prototype 'themes' I am working on.

 1. basic theme: Generate hierarchical pages.

 2. blog theme: basic + allow 'posts' Follows blog pattern:
  archived date stamped posts, with top summaries, tag and category view pages
  and an about page. This site is an outcome of this theme.

driven info site with comparative tables, SVG graphs etc.

2. Music Collection App. A single page app that is served from a networked
juke-box server. The networked juke-box server: A URL attached to a piece of
hardware that plays music - Suitable for cafes, flats, home etc.
